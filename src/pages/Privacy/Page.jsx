            {"\n"}Google Ads : {"\n"} This website uses Google conversion
            tracking. If you have reached our website via an ad placed by
            Google, Google Ads will set a cookie on your computer. The
            conversion tracking cookie is set when a user clicks on an ad placed
            by Google. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are
            not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain
            pages of our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and
            Google can recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was
            redirected to this page. Each Google Ads customer receives a
            different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked across Ads
            customers' websites. The information obtained using the conversion
            cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Ads customers who
            have opted in to conversion tracking. Clients learn the total number
            of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page
            tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive
            any information that can be used to personally identify users. If
            you do not wish to participate in the tracking, you can refuse the
            setting of a cookie required for this - for example, by means of a
            browser setting that generally deactivates the automatic setting of
            cookies or by setting your browser so that cookies from the domain
            "googleleadservices.com" are blocked. Please note that you may not
            delete the opt-out cookies as long as you do not want any
            measurement data to be recorded. If you have deleted all your
            cookies in the browser, you must set the respective opt-out cookie
            again. {"\n"}

            interest-based advertisements to website visitors within the Google

            of the website visitor, which makes it possible to recognize the
            visitor when they visit websites that belong to the Google
            advertising network. On these sites, the visitor can be presented
            with advertisements that relate to content that the visitor has
            previously accessed on websites that use Google's remarketing
            function. According to its own information, Google does not collect
            any personal data during this process. However, if you do not wish
            to use Google's remarketing function, you can deactivate it in
            principle by making the appropriate settings at
            http://www.google.com/settings/ads. Alternatively, you can
            deactivate the use of cookies for interest-based advertising via the

            This website uses the reCAPTCHA service of Google Ireland Limited

            serves the purpose of distinguishing whether the input is made by a
            human or by automated, machine processing. The query includes the
            sending of the IP address and possibly other data required by Google
            for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. For this purpose, your input is
            transmitted to Google and further used there. However, your IP
            address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states
            of the European Union or in other contracting states of the
            Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases
            will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the
            USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website,
            Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this
            service. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of
            reCaptcha will not be merged with other data from Google. Your data
            may also be transmitted to the USA in the process. For data
            transfers to the USA, there is an adequacy decision of the European
            Commission, the "Privacy Shield". Google participates in the
            "Privacy Shield" and has submitted to the requirements. By pressing
            the query, you consent to the processing of your data. The
            processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO with your consent.
            You can revoke your consent at any time without affecting the
            lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent
            until revocation. You can find more information about Google

            This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided
            by Google Ireland Limited. If the data controller on this website is
            located outside the European Economic Area or Switzerland, then the
            Google Analytics data processing is carried out by Google LLC.
            Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited are hereinafter referred to as
            "Google". The statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and
            make it more interesting for you as a user. This website also uses
            Google Analytics for a cross-device analysis of visitor flows, which
            is carried out via a user ID. If you have a Google user account, you
            can deactivate the cross-device analysis of your usage in the
            settings there under "My data", "Personal data". The legal basis for
            the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO.
            The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google
            Analytics will not be merged with other data from Google. We would
            like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been
            extended by the code "_anonymizeIp();" to ensure anonymized
            collection of IP addresses. This means that IP addresses are
            processed in abbreviated form, which means that they cannot be
            linked to a specific person. If the data collected about you is
            related to a person, this is immediately excluded and the personal
            data is deleted immediately. Only in exceptional cases will the full
            IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and
            shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google
            will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of
            the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing
            other services relating to website activity and internet usage to
            the website operator. For the exceptional cases in which personal
            data is transferred to the USA, Google has submitted to the EU-US
            Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.
            Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the
            cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a
            Google server in the USA and stored there. You may refuse the use of
            cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,
            however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use
            the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the
            collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use
            of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the
            processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the
            browser plugin available at the following link: Disable Google
            Analytics. In addition, you can also prevent the use of Google
            Analytics by clicking on this link: Disable Google Analytics. This
            will save a so-called opt-out cookie on your data carrier, which
            prevents the processing of personal data by Google Analytics. Please
            note that if you delete all cookies on your terminal device, these
            opt-out cookies will also be deleted, i.e. you will have to set the
            opt-out cookies again if you wish to continue to prevent this form
            of data collection. The opt-out cookies are set per browser and
            computer/end device and must therefore be activated separately for
            each browser, computer or other end device. {"\n"}
